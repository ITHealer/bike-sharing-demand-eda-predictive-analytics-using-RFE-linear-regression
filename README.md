# Bike Sharing Demand

The notebook is based on a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/overview). 

The objective of the analysis is to be able to predict the demand for bike sharing services based on historical data. The business wants to understand the key factors which lead to the highest impact on the demand for their services. 

After going through the EDA process, performing univariate and bivariate analyses, I trained a linear regression model on the dataset. I used a combination of Recursive Feature Elimination and manual feature selection to get to the best possible model. 

I tried several different variations before arriving at one that works best. The notebook also includes a residual analysis on the final model, and an evaluation of the model after running it on the test data.
